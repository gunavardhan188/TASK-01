Implementing caesar cipher for encryption and decryption
# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This is a simple Python script that allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption method where each letter in a message is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D'. Decryption reverses the process


## Usage

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:

       https://github.com/Secret-diary/Prodigy_CS_01.git

2. Navigate to the Project directory 

        cd prodigy

3. Run the script by executing 

        python3 prodigy_cs_01.py.

4. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted.

5. Enter the shift value to use for the cipher.

6. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message.

7. Optionally, choose whether you want to save the output to a file.

## Example

     1)Enter the message: first task

     2)Enter the shift value: 5

      3)Encrypt or Decrypt? (Type 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'): encrypt

      4)Do you want to save the output to a file? (yes/no): yes

      5)Result: knwxy yfxp

      6)Output saved to 'encrypt.txt' in the current working directory.
